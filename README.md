# Loadtest 

Kubernetes + [Locust.io](https://locust.io) based load testing harness for Ambassador.

# Setup

1. You need access to a Kubernetes cluster. I strongly recommend setting up a dedicated cluster for this tool as it is effectively designed to perform a distributed denial of service attack ("DDOS").
